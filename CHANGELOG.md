## 1.0.1 (2021-08-17)

### Additions

- Added a footer which shows the version of the randomizer and the BTD6 version that the randomizer is accurate till. Clicking on the footer takes you to the changelog for the randomizer.

### Fixes

- Fixed a bug where #Ouch, C.H.I.M.P.S., Psi & Engineer Monkey would never be chosen under normal circumstances.
- Fixed a mistake in the readme that said heroes do not repeat across players. However, multiple players are actually able to be assigned the same hero.

### Aesthetic Changes

- Switched the order of the randomization options to have "Randomize Mode" before "Randomize Heroes" so that the order of the options and results are consistent.
- Added a small spacing between the header and the main content.

### Other

- Corrected the initial application version to be 1.0.0 instead of 0.1.0.
